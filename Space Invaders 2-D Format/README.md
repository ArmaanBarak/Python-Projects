# Space Invaders

Main Game directory contains all the game files.

SpaceInvader1.py has version 1
SpaceInvader2.py has version 2

You can adjust the speed of player, bullet and enemies if it seems slow on your computer.
Speed also depends on computer processor and graphics.

Change the numerical value infront of player_x_change, bullet_y_change, enemy_x_change and enemy_y_change to adjust speed. Do not change values where they are kept 0 because they are meant to reset the speeds. Only change wherever these variables are assigned values.

To change the theme background sound change the value in mixer.music.load() and add 'Epic_Action_Movie.wav' below the comment loading sounds

Thank You and Enjoy the game!
